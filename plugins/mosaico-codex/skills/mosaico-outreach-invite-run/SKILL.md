# Mosaico Outreach Invitation Run

Before using any Outreach or browser tool, ask these questions in order unless the person already
provided the answer as part of the current invocation:

1. "Which days should this run cover: today, tomorrow, or a specific set of dates?"
2. "For those days, do you want to source Leads and prepare invitation drafts, send approved invitations, or both?"

Resolve today and tomorrow using the person's local business date. Preserve the exact selected dates
throughout the run. Accept one action and run only the selected scope.

## Start the run

1. Open LinkedIn's Me page in the authenticated browser and read the profile URL of the signed-in
   account. Report what you see; do not decide or correct it.
2. Call `outreach_start_run` with that URL as `observedLinkedInProfile` and the intent: `source_invitation_leads` for sourcing, `send_approved_invitations` for sending. When doing both, start a separate run for each scope.
3. Keep the returned `runId` and pass it on every `outreach_get_day` or `outreach_get_follow_ups`
   read and on every `outreach_save_lead`, `outreach_update_lead`, `outreach_record_message`,
   `outreach_deposit_conversation` and `outreach_mark_message_sent` call. Never pass `ownerUserId` on
   a write; Mosaico takes the owner from the run.
4. If Mosaico returns a blocker at any step, stop and tell the person what it says. Do not retry with
   a different profile or work around it. In a scheduled run, a blocker means stop and report.
5. Before `outreach_deposit_conversation` and `outreach_mark_message_sent`, open the Me page again and
   pass the profile you see then as `observedLinkedInProfile`.
6. If an Owner or Admin asks to run for a colleague, pass that member's id as `onBehalfOfMemberId` on
   `outreach_start_run` only. The LinkedIn account must then be that colleague's.

When a profile already exists under another owner, read the state Mosaico returns and follow its
recommended action. If `outreach_save_lead` returns `skipped` with `continue_sourcing`, nothing was
saved and this is not a blocker: note the candidate for your final report, source a replacement and
keep going. Mosaico records the skip on the run and does not count it toward the target. Stop only
when Mosaico returns a blocker, `human_decision_required` or `stop_run`; then show the person the
owner, Lead and status it returned. `outreach_deposit_conversation` returns such a blocker for a new
Lead. Re-send with `acknowledgeProfileOnOtherOwner: true` only after the person decides to; never
set it yourself.

## Source Leads and prepare drafts

1. Read `outreach_get_agents`, then call `outreach_get_day` for each selected day with
   `intent: source_invitation_leads`, `targetCount: 20`, and the `runId`.
2. Follow `workflowStatus.recommendedAction`. Use its prepared count, remaining count, blockers and
   completion result; do not reconstruct them from separate records or conversation memory.
3. A day with fewer than 20 qualified Leads is incomplete. Continue searching, broadening suitable
   searches, checking profiles, saving qualified Leads with their profile details and preparing
   missing invitation drafts until every selected day contains 20.
4. Do not stop because the work is slow, difficult, expensive or because an initial search produced
   only a few Leads. Loading 3 Leads is not completion; if 17 are still missing, continue until all
   17 are found.
5. Save each qualified Lead and its missing outbound Invite draft through the Mosaico tools. Do not
   approve or send any invitation in this scope.
6. Reread `outreach_get_day` after every saved Lead and draft. Mosaico preserves partial progress and
   owns the 20-Lead completion predicate; a valid partial save is not a completed run.
7. Report a shortfall only when a genuine Mosaico, authentication, LinkedIn or human-decision blocker
   prevents further work. State the exact completed count, remainder and blocker; never report the
   day as complete below 20.

## Send approved invitations

1. Call `outreach_get_day` for each selected date with `intent: send_approved_invitations` and
   the `runId`. Work only on exact outbound Invite messages returned as
   Approved and permitted by `workflowStatus`.
2. Never approve, rewrite, replace or substitute an invitation. If the approved body does not exactly
   match the body about to be sent, stop for that invitation and report the blocker.
3. Send through the authenticated LinkedIn browser.
4. Verify each invitation against LinkedIn rather than trusting the click.
5. Call `outreach_mark_message_sent` only after successful delivery verification, using the exact
   Lead and Message identities and the exact send time when LinkedIn exposes it, otherwise null.
6. Reread the same day after each send transition and continue until Mosaico reports completion or a
   genuine blocker.

## Both

1. Complete **Source Leads and prepare drafts** first and reach 20 Leads on every selected date.
2. Reread the current Mosaico state for those dates.
3. Complete **Send approved invitations** only for messages that were already human-approved. Never
   approve a newly created draft automatically.

For every scope, Mosaico is the workflow authority for stored state, target completion, ownership,
validation, allowed actions and recovery. Stop only when the selected scope is complete, Mosaico
reports a genuine blocker, or a human decision is required. Mosaico decides which member a record belongs to from the run; do not try to work that out yourself.
Only Owners and Admins can use Outreach.
