# Mosaico Outreach Follow-up Run

Before using any Outreach or browser tool, ask exactly:

> Do you want to check for new follow-ups, send approved drafts, both, or one pass per thread?

Accept only **check for new follow-ups**, **send approved drafts**, **both**, or **one pass per
thread**, and run only that scope. If the answer includes checking, ask before using tools:

> Do you also want me to write follow-up drafts for connected Leads who accepted the connection but have not replied?

Treat the answer as an additional drafting scope, not permission to approve or send those drafts. 

## Start the run

1. Open LinkedIn's Me page in the authenticated browser and read the profile URL of the signed-in
   account. Report what you see; do not decide or correct it.
2. Call `outreach_start_run` with that URL as `observedLinkedInProfile` and the intent: `check_follow_ups` for checking, `send_approved_follow_ups` for sending. When doing both, start a separate run for each scope.
3. Keep the returned `runId` and pass it on every `outreach_get_day` or `outreach_get_follow_ups`
   read and on every `outreach_save_lead`, `outreach_update_lead`, `outreach_record_message`,
   `outreach_deposit_conversation`, `outreach_mark_message_sent`, `outreach_record_delivery_block`,
   `outreach_record_connection_evidence` and `outreach_record_connections_snapshot` call. Never pass `ownerUserId` on
   a write; Mosaico takes the owner from the run.
4. Tell a run-level blocker from a one-Lead outcome. A run-level blocker is about the run itself:
   LinkedIn identity mismatch or not registered, the run expired, unknown or foreign, sign-in lost,
   or Mosaico or LinkedIn failing. Only then stop and tell the person what Mosaico says; do not retry
   with a different profile or work around it. Everything else is about one Lead or one Message:
   a `skipped` result, a `blocked` state, a refused write, a `history-mismatch`, a draft that
   already exists, a conflict, a not-found. Record what Mosaico returned, skip that Lead and
   continue with the next one; Mosaico keeps the Lead for a person in To sort. A scheduled run
   never stops for one Lead.
5. Before `outreach_deposit_conversation`, `outreach_mark_message_sent`,
   `outreach_record_delivery_block`, `outreach_record_connection_evidence` and
   `outreach_record_connections_snapshot`, open the Me page again
   and pass the profile you see then as `observedLinkedInProfile`.
6. If an Owner or Admin asks to run for a colleague, pass that member's id as `onBehalfOfMemberId` on
   `outreach_start_run` only. The LinkedIn account must then be that colleague's.

If `outreach_save_lead` or `outreach_deposit_conversation` reports that the profile already exists
under another owner, stop and show the person the owner, Lead and status. Re-send with
`acknowledgeProfileOnOtherOwner: true` only after the person decides to; never set it yourself.

## Check for new follow-ups

1. Work across all dates and read `outreach_get_follow_ups` with the `runId`. When the recommended
   action is `capture_connections`, run **Capture recent connections** once, then reread. When the
   recommended action is `verify_connection`, Mosaico lists the Leads whose connection is unknown or unverified in
   `unverifiedLeads`, each with its profile URL: for each one run **Capture connection evidence**, then
   reread `outreach_get_follow_ups`. Never guess a connection and never skip to drafting for a listed
   Lead.
2. For each returned Lead, open its pages directly: `navigation.messageUrl` (the stored
   conversation) when present, otherwise `navigation.profileUrl`. Do not search LinkedIn lists for
   Leads that carry a URL, and never read a LinkedIn list or button to decide whether a Lead is
   connected.
3. Inspect each relevant currently visible LinkedIn conversation. This is the by-eye form: see
   **Capture the thread** for why Codex cannot read threads from LinkedIn's data.
4. Deposit each complete visible conversation oldest to newest through
   `outreach_deposit_conversation` as `messages`, passing the conversation's URL as `linkedInMessageUrl` so
   the next run opens it directly. Do not compare it with stored history or decide which reply is newer;
   Mosaico owns identity matching, chronology, follow-up state, blockers and allowed actions. Say in the
   final report that these threads were read by eye.
5. Save every missing follow-up reply through `outreach_record_message` as an outbound follow-up
   draft with `sentAt` null.
6. If the person opted into connected Leads without replies, also save missing follow-up drafts for
   those Leads when Mosaico permits `draft_follow_up` (Mosaico permits it only for a Lead it lists as
   verified). Use their visible profile, stored conversation
   context and assigned Agent instructions; do not invent a reply from the Lead.
7. Continue drafting when Mosaico permits `draft_follow_up` even if a separate historical
   `message.kind` sorting issue remains.
8. Do not approve or send any message in this scope.

## Send approved drafts

1. Work only on exact outbound follow-up messages whose current Mosaico status is already Approved.
   Messages Mosaico returns as blocked are never sent; do not retry them.
2. Never approve, rewrite or substitute a message. If the approved body does not exactly match the
   body about to be sent, stop for that message and report the blocker.
3. Open the conversation directly through the `linkedInMessageUrl` Mosaico returns when present;
   otherwise open the Lead's profile and use Message. If the conversation cannot be opened or the
   person cannot be messaged, call `outreach_record_delivery_block` with `reason: cannot-message` and
   continue with the next message. Recording an outcome is not a blocker.
4. Send through the authenticated LinkedIn browser.
5. Verify delivery on LinkedIn rather than trusting the click.
6. Call `outreach_mark_message_sent` only after successful delivery verification, using the exact
   Lead and Message identities and the exact send time when LinkedIn exposes it, otherwise null.
   Codex cannot run the approved thread script, so it cannot pass `threadEvidence`: Mosaico records the
   mark as a reading of the screen and answers `send-proof-missing`. Say so in the final report, with
   each Lead. A Claude run, which runs the thread script again after the send, confirms a send from
   LinkedIn's data. If Mosaico answers `send-not-confirmed` it did not go out: do not retype it and do
   not mark it sent; call `outreach_record_delivery_block` with `reason: cannot-message` and continue.
7. Continue until every currently approved follow-up draft is sent or recorded, or Mosaico reports a
   genuine blocker (Mosaico, sign-in or LinkedIn failure). One Lead that cannot be messaged never
   stops the run.
8. In the final report list recorded outcomes separately from sends and blockers, each with its
   Lead and reason, and name the sends marked by screen.

## Capture the thread

Whether a person replied, when, and who said what, is a fact in LinkedIn's own messaging data. Mosaico
reads a thread from that data only when it is carried by the thread script of the Mosaico plugin for Claude
Code (`linkedin-thread-messages.js`): one approved script, run word for word in the signed-in LinkedIn page
and enforced by that plugin's browser-script gate. That script runs only in Claude's built-in browser pane.
Codex's page-script scope is sandboxed (it has no session cookies and cannot make the page's own requests),
so the Codex package cannot run it, and this run does not capture threads:

1. Never read, copy, export or look for a LinkedIn cookie, token or session: not from the page, browser
   storage, profile files, DevTools data or the keychain. Never write a script that calls LinkedIn.
2. Do not pass `threadEvidence` to `outreach_deposit_conversation`; it accepts only what the approved
   script returns.
3. Read each thread by eye, as in **Check for new follow-ups** and **One pass per thread**, and deposit it
   through `outreach_deposit_conversation` as `messages`. Mosaico stores such a thread as a reading, not
   as evidence.
4. Say in the final report that the threads were read by eye and that the thread script could not run in
   Codex. A run in Claude's built-in browser pane reads them from LinkedIn's data instead.

## Capture connection evidence

Whether you are connected to a Lead is a fact in LinkedIn's own data, not on the page's buttons. Mosaico
records a connection state only from that data, carried by the connection-evidence capability of the
Mosaico plugin for Claude Code: one approved script, run word for word in the signed-in LinkedIn page and
enforced by that plugin's browser-script gate. The Codex package has no such capability, so this run does
not capture connection evidence. For the same reason the Codex package cannot run the approved whoami
script either; read LinkedIn's Me page as above:

1. Never read, copy, export or look for a LinkedIn cookie, token or session: not from the page, browser
   storage, profile files, DevTools data or the keychain. Never write a script that calls LinkedIn.
2. Do not call `outreach_record_connection_evidence`; it accepts only what the approved script returns.
3. Leave the Lead unverified and list it as skipped, noting in the report only what the LinkedIn page
   visibly shows (a Message, Connect or Pending button) for the person to read. That note is never a
   connection state and never a reason to draft or send.
4. Continue with the next Lead. When the run cannot proceed without a verified connection, stop that
   step and report it.

## Capture recent connections

Whether an invitation was accepted is a fact in LinkedIn's own list of your connections, newest first,
not on a profile's buttons. Mosaico matches that list to the owner's own Leads only when it is carried by
the connection-evidence capability of the Mosaico plugin for Claude Code, under the same rules as
**Capture connection evidence**. The Codex package has no such capability, so when the read of
`outreach_get_follow_ups` returns the recommended action `capture_connections`:

1. Do not call `outreach_record_connections_snapshot`; it accepts only what the approved script returns,
   one page per call, and Codex cannot run that script.
2. Never compare names or decide who accepted yourself.
3. Report that the connections list was not captured, record nothing, continue with the rest of the run
   and reread `outreach_get_follow_ups`.

## Both

1. Complete **Check for new follow-ups** first.
2. Reread the current Mosaico state.
3. Complete **Send approved drafts** only for messages that were already human-approved. Never
   approve a newly created draft automatically.

## One pass per thread

The scope for a scheduled daily run: each LinkedIn conversation is opened once, and replies are
handled before anything else is sent.

1. Read `outreach_get_follow_ups` with the `runId`. When the recommended action is
   `capture_connections`, run **Capture recent connections** once, then reread. Work through every
   returned Lead in order. When the recommended action is `verify_connection`, run **Capture connection evidence** for each Lead in
   `unverifiedLeads` first and reread; never guess a connection and never draft for a Lead Mosaico
   still lists as unverified.
2. For each Lead, open `navigation.messageUrl` directly (the profile URL when there is no thread
   yet). If that URL opens a different
   person's conversation, do not deposit it: call `outreach_update_lead` with
   `linkedInMessageUrl: null` and `reason: wrong-person`, then open the Lead's profile and use
   Message to find the right thread; if it cannot be found, continue with the next Lead.
3. Deposit the complete visible conversation oldest to newest through
   `outreach_deposit_conversation` as `messages` (the by-eye form; see **Capture the thread**), passing the
   conversation's URL as `linkedInMessageUrl`. If Mosaico reports `returnedToDraft`, that Lead's approved
   follow-up is now a draft because a new reply arrived: do not send it.
4. Reread the Lead's state. If Mosaico still lists an approved outbound follow-up for it, send it
   exactly as approved, verify delivery on LinkedIn and call `outreach_mark_message_sent` only after
   successful verification. Codex cannot run the thread script, so Mosaico records the mark as a reading
   of the screen and answers `send-proof-missing`; say so in the report. If Mosaico answers
   `send-not-confirmed` it did not go out: do not retype it and do not mark it sent.
5. If the conversation cannot be opened or the person cannot be messaged, call
   `outreach_record_delivery_block` with `reason: cannot-message` and continue with the next Lead.
6. Save every missing follow-up draft Mosaico permits through `outreach_record_message` with
   `sentAt` null. Mosaico decides which Leads are due, including an accepted invitation without a
   reply, and permits a draft only for a Lead it lists as verified. Never approve a draft; never send a
   draft created in this run.
7. Continue until every Lead has been handled or Mosaico reports a genuine blocker (Mosaico,
   sign-in or LinkedIn failure). One Lead that fails is recorded and skipped, never a halt.
8. Report sends (all marked by screen in Codex), recorded outcomes, drafts written, Leads left
   unverified, and skipped Leads with reasons, separately.

For every scope, Mosaico is the workflow authority. Follow its allowed actions and recommended
action. Stop only when the selected scope is complete, Mosaico reports a genuine blocker, or a human
decision is required. Mosaico decides which member a record belongs to from the run; do not try to work that out
yourself. Only Owners and Admins can use Outreach.
